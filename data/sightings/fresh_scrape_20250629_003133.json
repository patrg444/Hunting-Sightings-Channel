    "full_text": "A piece of history in the middle of urban sprawl. This is a free access area. You can drive through the entire park. There is fishing allowed in multiple lakes. This requires a fishing permit/license. I saw a few \"honest john\" boxes for that. There is a visitor center with the history of the park. Get the kids near the window! Buffalo \"bison\" roam throughout the park. They are in big herds. Don't get out of your vehicle. Once you get to a certain point the road is one way and is about 5+ miles around the park. This allows you to pull over and take pictures from your window. Hundreds of animals roaming, including white tail deer, mule deer, buffalo, all sorts of birds and saw some burrowing owls. There is a free archery range just past the visitor center that looks well maintained. Bicycle and walking paths in parts of the beginning section with convenient benches. Once you turn onto the one way road it feels like you are transported back in time when the buffalo roamed everywhere. A hidden gem. Nice place to bring visiting friends and family."

This beautiful park offers a perfect blend of stunning scenery, diverse wildlife, and some of the best driving roads in the area.\n\nThe winding roads through the park are a driver's dream. Whether you're behind the wheel of a sports car or just enjoying a leisurely drive, the well-maintained roads offer a smooth ride with plenty of twists and turns to keep things exciting. The panoramic views of the surrounding mountains and valleys are breathtaking, making every mile a visual treat.\n\nFor those looking to stretch their legs, Genesee Park has a variety of well-marked hiking trails that cater to all skill levels. I particularly enjoyed the hikes that led to scenic overlooks, where you can take in the expansive vistas and the beauty of the Colorado landscape. The park is also home to a herd of bison, which is always a delight to see.\n\nThe facilities are clean and well-kept, with plenty of picnic areas and rest spots to relax and enjoy the natural surroundings. The visitor information center is helpful and provides great insights into the park\u2019s history and wildlife.\n\nWhether you're visiting for a scenic drive, a hike, or a picnic, Genesee Park is a fantastic destination that offers something for everyone. Highly recommended for a day out in nature with the added bonus of exhilarating driving roads!"

Toilets flush and there are sinks with running water, as well as a washing station for dishes and pans. A fair amount of space between this site and other sites. A065: AMAZING views! A steep hike to bathrooms, but there are flush-toilets, sinks and a washing station. If it's windy, there is nothing to shelter the tent. B204: I wouldn't recommend this one. Only vault toilets that smell SO bad. No sinks, but there is a water spigot for dishes. Sites are stacked close together. I could hear the guy two sites over snoring every night. If it's windy, there is a ridge that will protect your tent. On the other side of the ridge is the valley where elk congregate. In the fall, they bugle all night. I found this relaxing, but others may not. The  campsite as a whole: The rangers are nice and helpful. The couple selling firewood are super cranky. Best just to accept that fact and go with it. This isn't a party campground. Most of the people who stay there are there to hike and enjoy the scenery. Quiet hours are enforced by rangers - something I definitely appreciate. The rangers also walk around to make sure no one has left food out - thus keeping the bears away. They are very strict about letting you know that all food must be in the food lockers.

It was on the western side but still gave us access to drive to the eastern side at Estes Park. Although we had a camping reservation and could come and go as we wished at RMNP, we still had to get a Timed Reservation entry pass (only $2) online the day before we wanted to visit Bear Lake on the eastern side, which we are so thankful we did! We loved our special camping site in the B loop with our small teardrop camper because it was private and close to the bathrooms. We could hear the Elk making their mating calls during the twilight hours and it was so amazing to hear over and over! We did see some Elk near our campsite too! There are several hiking trails nearby that are worth visiting, like Coyote Trail and Holzwarth Historic Site.  There are plenty of Elk and Moose grazing nearby, too! We loved our time here and had a great camp host, Hunter! They also have firewood you can buy for $11 a bundle from 5-7 PM nightly, so you can always have a campfire in the evenings. It was only 9 miles from Grand Lake, so we could make trips there for lunch or to spend the day walking in their historic downtown, which was great. Highly recommend Timber Creek Campground in Rocky Mountain National Park!"

They allow hanging of hammocks. Which is nice for napping or reading a book during the afternoon. You can hear the creek while camping because it is right behind the sites. All of the sites for tents have a bear safe box. While we were there the pump for water was producing a very odd color well water. Similar to sun tea in color actually. The camp host has wood for $6. The host was very nice when we did encounter him. My son had cut himself and the host gave us some bandages. You will have to drive 30 minutes or so to get any supplies you may have forgotten. We had a moose and many deer come right through our site while there. Just before the bridge where you enter you can find a trail that is fairly even and not rough. My small son and I were able to easily navigate it while wearing sandals. The entire time were stayed our cellphones had 4g service. If you go down farther to camp Dick you will get no or very poor cell coverage."

The park was gorgeous and the bathrooms were clean. I saw a great mixture of campers and tents. Plenty of deer and cattle. One night we heard wolves howling in the distance. Two nights we had rain. We stayed in late July. Make sure you have fire starters. This is a moist area. I would recommend this place for sure. I am glad that our family came. I'm sure we were the loudest ones with four kids... \ud83d\udc4d There were other children and multiple hikers. There are plenty of people with kayaks because of the lakes. Easy access to Montrose and Ouray. Owl Creek pass is gorgeous. We made it in a non 4 wheel drive car before the rain, but heard it might be harder after. It is longer but gorgeous. Either way, if you are able to make this park part of your vacation, please do. Don't pass it up!"

    "full_text": "(Mid-June 2024) Very nice hike.\n\nHiked up in the afternoon, stayed the night, and hiked back down in the morning. Snow basically only in the basin on the final stretch, but doable if you've got confidence. Maybe bring poles. Also, the runoff crossing is quite big and I either recommend mid-calf high boots or just take them off and wade through barefoot--lots of people I saw spent quite a while looking for a perfect place to cross only to end up with wet shoes anyways \ud83d\ude43.\n\nSaw lots of smaller wildlife, and it's also moderately busy with people and their dogs during the day.\n\nIn terms of overnight, I'd recommend the valley flat before the final accent as it has lots of trees and flat green spaces if you are with a tent, although I stayed a bit higher up among the final trees with my hammock and hat an amazing view (but a bit of wind).\n\nIn general, I liked this one a lot: has a great destination and doesn't require entry fees or registration or anything, even for overnights."

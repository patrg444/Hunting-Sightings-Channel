# Real Data Implementation Status

## Current Status

### Reddit Scraper
- **API Integration**: Complete with PRAW
- **Credentials**: Set up in .env file
- **Status**: Currently falling back to simulation mode due to authentication
- **Note**: Reddit app may need time to activate, or try recreating the app

### 14ers.com Scraper
- **Current**: Using simulation mode with sample data
- **To Implement**: Need to inspect actual HTML structure and update selectors

### SummitPost Scraper
- **Current**: Using simulation mode with sample data
- **To Implement**: Need to parse actual route descriptions and comments

## Reddit Troubleshooting

If Reddit authentication continues to fail:
1. Wait 10-15 minutes for app activation
2. Double-check credentials in Reddit app settings
3. Try recreating the app as "script" type
4. Ensure user agent format is correct

## Next Steps for Real Data

### For 14ers.com:
1. Visit https://www.14ers.com/routes.php
2. Inspect HTML structure of trip reports
3. Update CSS selectors in scraper
4. Handle pagination for multiple pages

### For SummitPost:
1. Visit route pages like https://www.summitpost.org/mount-elbert/150325
2. Find selectors for route descriptions and comments
3. Update scraper to parse actual content
4. Handle different page layouts

## Testing Real Data

Once Reddit works:
```bash
# Test Reddit only
python scripts/test_reddit.py

# Run full scraping with real Reddit data
python scripts/sightings_cli.py --lookback 7
```

## Current Features Working

- Keyword extraction (50-char window)
- False positive filtering
- Species normalization
- Date filtering
- GMU mapping (ready for real polygon data)
- Multiple source aggregation
- Graceful fallback on API failures

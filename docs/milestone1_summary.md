# Milestone 1 Completion Summary

## Deliverables Completed

### 1. Colorado GMU Polygons ✓
- **Location**: `data/gmu/colorado_gmu_sample.geojson`
- Created sample polygons for GMU units 12 and 201
- Implemented GMUProcessor class with:
  - Point-in-polygon queries to determine which GMU contains a location
  - GeoJSON export functionality
  - Simplified polygon generation for web mapping

### 2. Trail Index for Colorado Units ✓
- **Location**: `data/trails/colorado_trails.json`
- Aggregated 7 trails from:
  - 5 peaks from 14ers.com (Mount Elbert, Mount Massive, Mount Harvard, Blanca Peak, La Plata Peak)
  - 2 routes from SummitPost (Mount Evans, Grays Peak)
- Trail data includes: name, lat/lon coordinates, elevation, source
- Also exported as CSV: `data/trails/colorado_trails.csv`

### 3. Technical Design Document ✓
- **Location**: `docs/technical_design.md`
- Comprehensive system architecture
- API rate limits and compliance notes for each source
- Infrastructure recommendations
- Security considerations
- Future enhancement roadmap

## Key Classes Implemented

### BaseScraper
- Rate limiting between requests
- Keyword-based wildlife sighting extraction (50-char window)
- False positive filtering
- Session management with proper User-Agent

### GMUProcessor
- Load GMU polygons from GeoJSON/Shapefile
- Point-in-polygon queries for location mapping
- Export simplified polygons for web use
- Trail-to-GMU mapping capabilities

### TrailProcessor
- Aggregate trails from multiple sources
- Fuzzy name matching for trail lookup
- Map trails to GMUs
- Export to JSON/CSV formats

## Configuration System

Created `config/settings.yaml` with:
- Target GMUs: 12, 28, 37, 38, 39, 201
- Game species keywords for: elk, deer, bear, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, mountain goat
- Source configurations with rate limits
- Email and database settings
- Scraping schedule (2 AM MT daily)

## Next Steps (Milestone 2)

Ready to implement:
1. **14ers.com scraper** - Parse trip reports for wildlife mentions
2. **SummitPost scraper** - Extract sightings from route descriptions
3. **Reddit scraper** - Use PRAW to search r/14ers, r/coloradohikers
4. **CLI tool** - Query sightings by date/GMU/species
5. **Database setup** - PostgreSQL schema for storing sightings

## Notes

- Sample GMU polygons are placeholders; real data should be downloaded from Colorado Parks & Wildlife
- Trail locations are currently not mapped to GMUs (all show empty arrays) because sample GMUs don't overlap with trail coordinates
- Virtual environment created with all dependencies installed
- Git repository initialized with first commit

## Commands to Get Started

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run setup again if needed
python scripts/setup_milestone1.py

# View trail data
cat data/trails/colorado_trails.json | jq

# View GMU boundaries
cat data/gmu/colorado_gmu_sample.geojson | jq

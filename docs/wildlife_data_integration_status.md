# Wildlife Data Integration Status

**Date:** June 4, 2025
**Status:** iNaturalist Working |  Observation.org API Changed

## Working Integration: iNaturalist

Successfully pulling wildlife observations with:
- **GMU Mapping**: Every observation mapped to Colorado GMU
- **Trail Proximity**: Closest trail/peak with distance
- **Photo Verification**: Research-grade observations only
- **Time/Location**: Exact GPS coordinates and timestamps

### Example Output:
```
Black Bear | 2025-05-30 | GMU 391 | Arthur Lakes Trail | 0.4 mi
Black Bear | 2025-05-29 | GMU 581 | Blue Mountain Peak | 1.7 mi
Black Bear | 2025-05-26 | GMU 29 | Devils Thumb Trail | 0.1 mi
```

### Statistics:
- Average distance to trail: 0.6 miles
- 76% of sightings within 1 mile of trail
- GMU coverage: 10+ different units

## Issue: Limited Species Diversity

Current data shows only black bears because:
1. **Seasonal patterns** - Late May/June is peak black bear activity
2. **Small sample size** - Only 17 observations in 30 days
3. **Research-grade filter** - High quality bar limits volume

### Solutions to Increase Diversity:

1. **Extend time window**:
 ```python
 sightings = scraper.scrape(lookback_days=90) # 3 months
 ```

2. **Include all quality grades**:
 ```python
 # In iNaturalist scraper, change:
 'quality_grade': 'research' # to: 'casual,needs_id,research'
 ```

3. **Add seasonal analysis**:
 - Fall: More elk/deer during hunting season
 - Spring: Bear emergence, turkey activity
 - Winter: Concentrate near winter range

## Observation.org Status

The API endpoint (https://waarneming.nl/api/v1/observations) returns 404. Possible causes:
- API version changed (v2?)
- Now requires authentication
- Different endpoint structure

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Use iNaturalist with extended timeframe
2. **Short-term**:
 - Debug Observation.org API
 - Consider eBird for game birds
 - Add GBIF for historical data
3. **Long-term**:
 - State wildlife agency APIs
 - Trail camera networks
 - Hunter-submitted reports

## Conclusion

The system successfully provides WHERE (GMU), WHAT (species), and WHEN (date/time) data with trail access information. While currently limited to black bears, the infrastructure is solid and ready for additional data sources to increase species diversity.

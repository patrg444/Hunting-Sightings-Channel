# Hunting Sightings Channel - Scraper Analysis

## Overview
The project contains 10 different scrapers targeting 6 data sources. Some sources have multiple implementation variants to handle different challenges.

## Data Sources & Scrapers

### 1. **14ers.com** (3 variants)
- **Basic**: `fourteeners_scraper.py` - MVP with simulated data
- **Real**: `fourteeners_scraper_real.py` - Actual HTTP scraping
- **Authenticated**: `fourteeners_auth_scraper.py` - Login-based for member content

**Key Features**:
- Trip reports from Colorado 14er climbs
- Focus on wildlife sightings in reports
- Authenticated version accesses more content

### 2. **SummitPost.org** (3 variants)
- **Basic**: `summitpost_scraper.py` - MVP with simulated data
- **Real**: `summitpost_scraper_real.py` - HTTP scraping (encounters 403 errors)
- **Browser**: `summitpost_playwright_scraper.py` - Full browser automation

**Key Features**:
- Peak descriptions and trip reports
- Playwright version bypasses anti-scraping
- Slower but more reliable browser approach

### 3. **Reddit** (1 scraper)
- **File**: `reddit_scraper.py`
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 with PRAW
- **Target Subreddits**: cohunting, elkhunting, bowhunting, ColoradoHiking, 14ers

**Key Features**:
- Caching system to avoid reprocessing
- LLM validation for sighting verification
- Processes posts and comments
- Location confidence radius extraction

### 4. **Google Places** (1 scraper)
- **File**: `google_places_scraper.py`
- **Authentication**: API Key
- **Compliance**: 30-day retention for raw reviews

**Key Features**:
- Trailhead reviews analysis
- LLM-powered wildlife mention extraction
- Deduplication tracking
- Event date extraction from text

### 5. **iNaturalist** (1 scraper)
- **File**: `inaturalist_scraper.py`
- **Authentication**: None (public API)
- **Data Quality**: Research-grade observations only

**Key Features**:
- Scientific wildlife observations
- Precise GPS coordinates
- Photo URLs included
- Observer information

### 6. **Observation.org** (1 scraper)
- **File**: `observation_org_scraper.py`
- **Authentication**: None (public API)
- **Coverage**: International platform with Colorado data

**Key Features**:
- Photo-verified observations
- Broader species coverage
- Scientific names for searches
- Validation status tracking

## Authentication Methods Summary

| Scraper | Auth Method | Requirements |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| 14ers Basic/Real | None | Public access |
| 14ers Auth | Form Login | Username/Password |
| SummitPost Basic/Real | None | Public access |
| SummitPost Playwright | Browser | Playwright installed |
| Reddit | OAuth2 | Client ID/Secret |
| Google Places | API Key | Google Cloud account |
| iNaturalist | None | Public API |
| Observation.org | None | Public API |

## Data Quality Hierarchy

1. **Highest Quality**: iNaturalist (research-grade, GPS coords)
2. **High Quality**: Observation.org (photo-verified)
3. **Medium Quality**: Google Places, Reddit (LLM-validated)
4. **Variable Quality**: Forum scrapers (user-generated content)

## Technical Approaches

### Anti-Scraping Solutions
- **Basic HTTP**: Works for 14ers, fails for SummitPost
- **Enhanced Headers**: Partial success for SummitPost
- **Browser Automation**: Full success via Playwright
- **API Access**: Most reliable (Reddit, Google, iNaturalist)

### Validation Methods
- **Keyword Matching**: Basic scrapers
- **LLM Validation**: Reddit, Google Places
- **Pre-validated**: iNaturalist (research-grade)
- **Photo Verification**: Observation.org

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching**: Reddit scraper tracks processed posts
- **Deduplication**: Google Places review tracking
- **Rate Limiting**: All API-based scrapers
- **Batch Processing**: Where APIs support it

## Recommendations

1. **Production Use**:
   - Prefer API-based scrapers (more stable)
   - Use authenticated versions where available
   - Implement robust error handling

2. **Data Integration**:
   - Prioritize high-quality sources (iNaturalist)
   - Use LLM validation for user-generated content
   - Implement location confidence radius for all sources

3. **Maintenance**:
   - Monitor for API changes
   - Update browser automation regularly
   - Keep authentication credentials secure

4. **Consolidation Opportunities**:
   - Remove basic MVP scrapers in production
   - Standardize LLM validation across all scrapers
   - Implement unified caching system

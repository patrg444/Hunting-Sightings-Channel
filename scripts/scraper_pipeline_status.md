# Hunting Sightings Channel - Scraper Pipeline Status

## ✅ Full Pipeline is Operational

All components of the scraper pipeline are working correctly and saving to Supabase.

## Test Results (24-hour lookback)

### Reddit Scraper
- **Status**: ✅ Working
- **Found**: 7 wildlife sightings
- **Saved**: 2 new sightings (5 were duplicates)
- **Features working**:
  - LLM validation with GPT-4.1 nano
  - Location confidence radius extraction (2-40 miles)
  - Post caching to avoid reprocessing
  - Deduplication via content_hash

### iNaturalist Scraper
- **Status**: ✅ Working (no new observations in test period)
- **API integration**: Functional
- **GPS coordinates**: Captured when available

### Database Integration
- **Supabase connection**: ✅ Working
- **Deduplication**: ✅ Working (prevented 5 duplicate saves)
- **Content hash**: ✅ Generated for all sightings
- **Current total**: 710 sightings

## Key Features Verified

1. **Incremental Saving** ✅
   - Each sighting saved immediately after extraction
   - No data loss if scraper fails partway

2. **Location Confidence Radius** ✅
   - Successfully extracting radius estimates
   - Examples: 2 miles (specific location), 40 miles (vague location)

3. **Caching System** ✅
   - Reddit posts cached by title + datetime
   - Reduces LLM API calls on re-runs

4. **Rate Limiting** ✅
   - 20.5 second delay between LLM calls
   - Respects OpenAI 3 RPM limit

5. **Coordinates & Geocoding** ✅
   - LLM attempts to extract coordinates when mentioned
   - Falls back to location names for future geocoding

## AWS Lambda Deployment

The full pipeline is deployed to AWS Lambda with:
- Daily execution at 2 AM UTC
- 1-day lookback period
- All scrapers included
- Cache uses Lambda's `/tmp` directory

## Recent Activity

From the test run:
- `bear` sighting on 2025-06-28 (40 mile radius)
- `deer` sighting on 2025-06-29 (10 mile radius)

## Cost Optimization

With current configuration:
- Only scrapes last 24 hours of content
- Caches posts to avoid reprocessing
- Uses GPT-4.1 nano (faster, cheaper)
- Deduplication prevents duplicate API calls

## Conclusion

The scraper pipeline is **fully operational** and correctly:
1. Scrapes new wildlife sightings
2. Validates with LLM
3. Extracts location confidence radius
4. Saves to Supabase
5. Prevents duplicates
6. Runs daily on AWS Lambda

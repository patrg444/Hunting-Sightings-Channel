# Reddit Scraper Cache Deployment Status

## ✅ Cache IS Deployed to AWS Lambda

The Reddit post caching mechanism that tracks title + datetime to avoid reprocessing is **fully deployed** to AWS Lambda.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Cache Location
- **Local**: `data/cache/parsed_posts.json`
- **Lambda**: `/tmp/cache/parsed_posts.json` (automatically detected)

The `llm_validator.py` automatically detects the Lambda environment:
```python
# Line 31 in llm_validator.py
cache_dir = "/tmp/cache" if os.environ.get('AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME') else "data/cache"
```

### 2. Cache Key Components
The cache tracks for each Reddit post:
- **Post ID**: Unique identifier
- **Post datetime**: Creation timestamp
- **Post title**: Title text
- **Parsed sightings**: Extracted wildlife mentions

### 3. Lambda Deployment Package
The deployment script (`create_deployment_package.sh`) includes:
- Line 15: `cp -r ../scrapers $TEMP_DIR/` - Copies entire scrapers module
- This includes `llm_validator.py` with caching functionality
- This includes `reddit_scraper.py` that uses the cache

### 4. Cache Behavior in Lambda
- Cache persists for the duration of the Lambda container (warm starts)
- Cache is lost when Lambda container is recycled (cold starts)
- This is acceptable because:
  - Daily runs with 1-day lookback won't see the same posts
  - Cache mainly helps during the same execution run
  - Cold starts are infrequent for scheduled functions

## Current Status

✅ **Fully Operational** - The cache mechanism is:
1. Implemented in the code
2. Included in the Lambda deployment package
3. Configured to use Lambda's `/tmp` directory
4. Working to prevent duplicate processing of Reddit posts

## Cache Effectiveness

During each Lambda execution:
- First subreddit processes all new posts
- Subsequent subreddits benefit from cache hits for cross-posted content
- Comments are also cached to avoid reprocessing
- Significantly reduces LLM API calls and costs

## No Further Action Needed

The caching system is fully deployed and operational in AWS Lambda.

SIGHTINGS LOCATION DATA SUMMARY
==============================

Total sightings in database: 794

Sightings WITH location coordinates: 377
- These are older sightings from 2025-06-27
- They have PostGIS geometry data (e.g., "0101000020E6100000...")
- Examples include: Estes Park, Rocky Mountain National Park, Bear Lake, etc.

Sightings WITHOUT location coordinates: 417
- These are the newly scraped sightings from 2025-06-28/29
- They only have location_name text (e.g., "Bear Creek Falls, Ouray")
- They DO have location_confidence_radius values (estimated accuracy in miles)

WHY THE MAP ISN'T SHOWING SIGHTINGS:
1. The frontend filters to show only the last 5 days of sightings
2. All recent sightings (last 5 days) are the new ones WITHOUT coordinates
3. The map needs lat/lng coordinates to display markers

SOLUTION:
To see sightings on the map at localhost:5173, you need to either:
1. Geocode the new sightings' location_name values to get coordinates
2. Or temporarily modify the frontend to show older sightings (from June 27) that have coordinates
3. Or use a geocoding service to convert location names to coordinates on the fly

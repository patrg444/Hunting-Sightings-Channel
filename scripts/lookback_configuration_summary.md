# Hunting Sightings Channel - Lookback Configuration Summary

## Current Configuration ✅

All scrapers are properly configured to use a **1-day lookback period** for daily runs, which minimizes API costs and prevents re-scraping old data.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Local Scraping (`scripts/run_scrapers.py`)
- **Line 142**: `sightings = run_all_scrapers(lookback_days=1)`
- Hardcoded to 1 day for daily runs

### 2. AWS Lambda (`lambda/daily_scraper.py`)
- **Line 106**: `lookback_days = event.get('lookback_days', 1)`
- Defaults to 1 day but can be overridden via Lambda event
- **Line 147**: Each scraper called with `scraper.scrape(lookback_days=lookback_days)`

### 3. Individual Scrapers

#### Reddit Scraper ✅
- Properly filters posts by date
- Stops iteration when reaching posts older than cutoff
- Example: `if post_date < cutoff_date: break`

#### iNaturalist Scraper ✅
- Uses API date parameters: `'d1': start_date`
- API handles filtering server-side

#### Fourteeners Scraper ✅
- Filters trip reports: `if report_date >= cutoff_date`
- Only includes recent reports

#### Google Places Scraper ⚠️
- **Note**: Ignores lookback_days parameter
- API limitation - returns most recent reviews without date filtering
- This is documented in the code

#### Observation.org Scraper ✅
- Uses API parameters: `'startdate': start_date, 'enddate': end_date`
- Server-side date filtering

## Cost Optimization

With the 1-day lookback configuration:
- **Reddit**: Only fetches posts from last 24 hours
- **iNaturalist**: API call limited to 1 day of observations
- **14ers.com**: Only scrapes recent trip reports
- **Google Places**: Limited by API (returns recent reviews)

## Manual Override

For historical data collection, you can override the lookback period:
```python
# Local script
sightings = run_all_scrapers(lookback_days=30)

# Lambda invocation
event = {'lookback_days': 30}
```

## Recommendations

1. ✅ **Current setup is optimal** for daily runs
2. ✅ **Costs are minimized** with 1-day lookback
3. ✅ **No changes needed** - configuration is correct

## Daily Schedule

The Lambda function is scheduled to run daily at 2 AM UTC, which ensures:
- Fresh data every morning
- Minimal API usage (only new content)
- No duplicate scraping of old data
